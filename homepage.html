    <p class="center">Welcome to a basic introduction on how Javascript, short = js, works & a short explanation on what "var" is about and how to use it. 
        Once you have read through all of this you will begin on a quiz where you answer / write a code and have to check if it is correct or not.
        If you make a mistake you will get a hint that will help you to get the right answer.
        Once you have fnished all of the given opjectives in the quiz, you have gotten a very basic understanding on javascript and how it excatly works.
        Once you have finished reading all the text here, you can proceed on and take the quiz, but be warned, once started you can't return back without re-opening the homepage.
        You have been warned... Good luck.
